Adya (acquired by Qualys),Software Development,IN,"Adya helps enterprises manage and secure their SaaS applications. 

As enterprises move to cloud applications - GSuite, O365, Slack, etc - they find it difficult to administer this SaaS sprawl. They are confronted with three problems: 

a) Administration: Each new SaaS application brings with it a new management console that an admin has to get familiar with and repeat the same set of steps. This is a waste of time & is error-prone.

b) License Management: While the per-month/ per-user pricing of SaaS apps starts off looking inexpensive, the costs spiral quickly with more users and more SaaS apps. 

c) Security and Compliance : Cloud applications make it very easy to collaborate and to share data widely.  IT would like to know what data is shared, which external users have access and which users are exposing data.

Adya solves these problems. We provide a single tool with the following benefits:

1. Central Administration: Perform the most critical and oft-repeated tasks from a single console to save time and to reduce administrator errors.

2. Security and Compliance: Understand where sensitive data is, who outside the company has access, who inside the company has been sharing it and take steps to prevent it. Get alerted in real-time if sensitive data is exposed..

3. Auditing and Reporting: Get pre-defined & custom reports to understand activity of privileged users, of employees on their way out the door, consultants etc. Prepare reports quickly to satisfy your auditor on who has access to critical data  no matter where in the cloud that data may be.

4. License Management: Understand how many licenses are provisioned for your critical (and expensive!) SaaS applications and get alerted if licenses are under-utilized to find potential savings. Manage your licenses from a single console and get an impartial and independent third party to help save you money.

There was a time when that didnt matter. Those days are gone. Data is now accessible, copious, and dispersed, and it includes an alarming amount of business-critical information. Its a target for both cybercriminals and regulators but securing it is incredibly difficult. Its the data challenge of our generation.

Existing approaches arent doing the job. Keyword searches produce a bewildering array of possibly relevant documents that may or may not be business critical. Asking users to categorize documents requires extensive training and constant vigilance to make sure users are doing their part.

FluxGen Technologies,"Water, Waste, Steam, and Air Conditioning Services",IN,"""Indian industries are huge consumers of waterand are facing increasingly stringent regulations to reduce water consumption, and even production downtime due to water scarcity. Large buildings and campuses in various parts of India increasingly have to buy tanker water which is expensive and often, low quality water. Water stress will only increase in coming years, not because we have a water shortage, but because we use water irresponsibly and manage it poorly. Water distribution pipelines in cities, for example, have leakages equal to 25-40%. Not only does this waste water, but also the energy that is needed to lift and transport water long distances. The True Cost of water is, indeed, very high.  

 

FluxGen's Water Intelligence SaaS Platform AquaGen leverages IoT, AI and Distributed Ledger to tracking, measure and analysing water consumption data, and uses to identify ways to reduce usage and wastage. Thus, we reduce the cost of water for our clients and help industries become more responsible and sustainable, and well as de-risking from water crisis.  

 

The system is operating at 60+ industrial siteour clients include food processing plants, metals and mining sites, pharmaceutical factories and commercial buildings. Installing AquaGen takes only a few days and clients get detailed data and recommendations which can be used to meet statutory reporting requirements as well. We have helped clients save up to 30% of their water consumption, and we have a vision that companies will become water positive in the future. Our near-term goal is to help save 1 Billion litres of Water per day! """,

IndianMoney.com,E-Learning Providers,IN,"In early 2008 Mr. C S Sudheer (Founder of IndianMoney.com) happened to meet an auto driver while working in a top MNC Broking house. The auto driver told him that one of the sales persons from his organization has sold him an insurance policy promising that ""If you pay Rs 25,000 once, you will get back Rs 1 lakh after 3 years"".

Mr. Sudheer knew there was no such policy available. When he read the policy document he realized that it was a Regular Premium ULIP policy, where customer has to pay Rs 25,000 each for 3 years. Based on the market performance, customer ""might"" get back Rs 50,000 or Rs 75,000 or Rs 1 lakh after 3 years.

It was clear that the humble auto driver wasn't made aware of the terms and conditions and complete details of the policy. It was literally impossible for an auto driver in Bangalore to save Rs. 25,000 a year for the rest of the installments. This incident shook Mr. Sudheer, he knew that there was a need for genuine, honest and unbiased financial advice and he instantly started thinking for a solution to end this problem. That's when IndianMoney.com was conceptualized, to end the unethical sales practices which are mostly in practice in the Financial Services Industry.

Mr. Sudheer paid Rs. 25,000 to the auto driver so that he at least recovers the money he had put into and also submitted his resignation to his CEO.

JNU also received the Best University Award from the President of India in 2017.
Still a young university, established by an act of Parliament in 1966, the strength, energy, and reputation of Jawaharlal Nehru University result from the vision that ideas are a field for adventure, experimentation and unceasing quest, and that diversity of opinions are the basis for intellectual exploration. JNU is the place for the intellectually restless, the insatiably curious, and the mentally rigorous, giving them the space to grow amidst the calmness of an oasis, a green lung within the hustle and bustle and the crowds of the capital city of India.
Coming into being in 1969, three years after its establishment by Parliament, JNU brought frontier disciplines and newer perspectives for old disciplines to the Indian university system. The excellent teacher-student ratio at 1:10, the mode of instruction which encourages students to explore their own creativity instead of reproducing received knowledge, and of exclusively internal evaluation, were also new to the Indian academic landscape and have stood the test of time.

We are a team of Big Data and Business Strategy evangelists. We build enterprise data based strategy tools that help Senior Business Management in their Daily planning and Decision making.

All the world's slice-&-dice systems and MISs are not enough to cater the needs of Senior management. If you are a C-level executive at a data mature company, this must come as no surprise to you.

Every business needs Decision Support Systems(DSS) that can derive predictive signals, analyse opportunity & related costs/risks, and assist managment in improving processes.

The unfortunate absence of these DSS has brought AI into lime light one step early. The truth of the matter is, AI is nothing but a machine learning algorithm that is applied on the decisions that are collected as data points from your decision support system.

Mego- is a DSS with a Do It Yourself Big-Data Analytics Toolkit. No-Coding, No-Jargon, pure business value.

It provides all the software support you need to make a business decision.

The required Business Contextualisation is done by the veterans with more than 2 decades experience in the field of data intelligence and decision science. 

Mego is equipped with very powerful strategy tools and business algorithms configured and customized for your business. These algorithms and tools can be chained together to build very complex business scenarios as intuitively as a kid builds Lego Blocks using lego bricks. 

Many senior managers and executives in organizations are aggressively pursuing AI. Mego is a necessary step in doing that. With so much data to consider before making a decision, Managers are solving less number of problems every day, while becoming more and more busy.

Transforming data richness into business enrichment:
Work with Big Data yourself without any technical assistance. Earn back the dexterity with insights and the fun of strategy planning.
